# Overview
#tool #overview 

We created an overview for the grading tools:
- [[research/tools/Gradescope]]
- [[research/tools/Codeexpert]]
- [[research/tools/Crowdmark]]
- [[research/tools/Ans]]
- [[research/tools/DBF Excel Grading]]
- [[research/tools/Graide]] 

Moreover we tried to gather evidence for [[efficiency gains]] of [[research/tools/Gradescope]] and [[research/tools/Crowdmark]].

Other tools that would potentially be interesting (but we did not create an overview for) include:
- [Athene](https://github.com/ls1intum/Athene)
- [Essay Feedback Tool of H5P](https://h5p.org/content-types/essay)
- [Pearson Automated Scoring Software](https://www.pearsonassessments.com/large-scale-assessments/k-12-large-scale-assessments/automated-scoring.html)
- [TestWe](https://testwe.eu/en/)
