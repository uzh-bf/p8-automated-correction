### What is Code Expert?
"Code Expert is a ready-to-use and platform independent online IDE that allows thousands of students at ETH ZÃ¼rich to work on open programming tasks in exercises and exams."

### How and where is Code Expert used?
Code Expert is used for assignments and exams in both introductory and advanced programming classes. At the point of writing, Code Expert is exclusively used at ETH Zurich. The platform is exclusively used for programming classes and it does not aim to be a general exam environment.

### How is Code Expert relevant for our project
While Code Expert is no holistic solution for online exam it may be a source of inspiration. The tool can be tested [here](https://expert.ethz.ch/enroll/SS22/eduHub) (unclear how long this link is valid).
