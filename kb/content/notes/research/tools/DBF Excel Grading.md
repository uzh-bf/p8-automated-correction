### What is the DBF Excel Grading tool?
The Teaching Center of the Department of Banking and Finance (DBF) developed a tool for the automated creation and correction of problem sets and exams solved in Microsoft [[research/exams/design/Question Types/Excel]]. Since 2020 it is sucessfully used in various courses of the Department of Banking and Finance.

### Aim of the DBF Excel Grading Tool
The aim of the DBF Excel Grading tool is to facilitate the personalization of problem sets and exams and their fully automated correction. While the personalization makes cheating more difficult, the fully automated correction heavily decreases the workload and mitigates the risk of human errors.

### Features
The main features of the tool are the generation of personalized exams and their fully automated correction. All exercises whose solution can be specified using an Excel formula can be graded automatically. Fully open questions (e.g. open text questions) are presented in the output of the tool and can be graded by hand in a seperate step.
