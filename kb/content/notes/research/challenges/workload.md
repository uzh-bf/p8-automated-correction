#challenge

The workload connected with grading open-ended questions is a big challenge, especially in large courses. This incentivizes people to use other question types (such as multiple choice) in their exams. According to the participants of our [survey](research/survey/Summary-of-Initial-Survey.md), the workload is the biggest obstacle to the incorporation of open-ended questions in exams.

This challenge must be addressed if people should be encouraged to use more open-ended questions in their exams. This can partly be achieved through the [Digitization](research/features/definitions/Digitization) of the grading process and, related to this, a well-designed [Grading Workflow](research/features/definitions/Grading-Workflow). In order to reduce the workload of the grading process even further, parts of the grading must be automated (see [Semiautomated Grading](research/concepts/Semiautomated-Grading) and [Automated Grading](research/concepts/Automated-Grading)).
