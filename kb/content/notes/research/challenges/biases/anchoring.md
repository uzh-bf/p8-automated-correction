The Anchoring Effect is a well-researched cognitive bias (see [Wikipedia Page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)>)) whereby people's decision are influenced by a particular reference points (anchor).

While the other listed biases can be addresses through the use of software, this bias would potentially arise from the use of software if software is used for the [sorting](research/features/definitions/sorting.md) of answers. If some answer is sorted into a cohort which has some positive (negative) attributes (e.g. a keyword the examiner is looking for) this setting may present an anchor and bias the examiner to award more (less) points.
