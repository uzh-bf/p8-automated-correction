# Discrimination
#bias 

The name of the student may have an effect on the numbers of points awarded (e.g. through gender or race bias). There exists a substantial amount of literature on this topic (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/scholar?hl=de&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=grading+discrimination&oq=grading+discrim)).

This bias may occur if the exams are not anonymized. [[research/features/definitions/Anonymity]] would mitigate large parts of this problem. It, however, may still be possible for the grader to identify the sex of the student based on the handwriting. This could be resolved if [[research/features/definitions/Text Recognition]] is used and the grader is presented machine written text.
