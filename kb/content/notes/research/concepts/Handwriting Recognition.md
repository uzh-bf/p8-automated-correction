# Handwriting Recognition
#concept

Recognize text from handwritten documents. This is a way harder problem than recognizing printed text as the variability of handwritten text can be way higher.

Handwriting text recognition can either be conducted:
- **"Offline"** (no information on pen movement available)
  Offline text recognition uses [[research/concepts/Optical Character Recognition]] techniques.  Tools where "offline" handwriting recognition is supported are, for example, [[Azure OCR API]] and [[Google Keep Notes]]. 

- **"Online"** (information on pen movement available)
  Since in "online" text recognition more information is available to the computer it outperforms "offline" text recognition. An tool where "online" handwriting recognition is supported is [[Microsoft One Note]]. Online text recognition works considerably better than offline text recognition.

Handwriting recognition works way better for english than for german text (see e.g. in [[Azure OCR API]]).
