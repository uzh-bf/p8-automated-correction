# Semiautomated Grading

#concept

Semiautomated grading facilitates the grading process by automating and assisting certain aspects of grading. Semiautomated grading involves automated features which may have an impact on the points students are awarded, but also features which are purely assisting the grader, e.g. by making his or her workflow more efficient (see [Feature Categories](research/features/Feature Categories)).

In contrast to [Automated Grading](research/concepts/Automated Grading), humans are still involved in the correction process and verify the suggestions of machines.
