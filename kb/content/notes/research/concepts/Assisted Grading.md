# Assisted Grading
#concept #definition 

Assisted Grading facilitates the grading process by assisting the grader in their grading process, e.g. by improving the efficiency of the workflow of the grader. 

In contrast to [[research/concepts/Automated Grading]] and [[research/concepts/Semiautomated Grading]], Assissted Grading software includes only features which do not have a direct impact (e.g. through suggestions) on the points that the students are awarded (see [[research/features/Feature Categories]]).
