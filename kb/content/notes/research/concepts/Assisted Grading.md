# Assisted Grading

#concept

Assisted Grading facilitates the grading process by assisting the grader in their grading process, e.g. by improving the efficiency of the workflow of the grader.

In contrast to [Automated Grading](research/concepts/Automated Grading) and [Semiautomated Grading](research/concepts/Semiautomated Grading), Assisted Grading software includes only features which do not have a direct impact (e.g. through suggestions) on the points that the students are awarded (see [Feature Categories](research/features/Feature Categories)).
