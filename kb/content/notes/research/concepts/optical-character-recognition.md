# Optical Character Recognition

#concept

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the conversion of images of text to machine-encoded text.

Traditional OCR processes one character at a time and focuses on typed text. More modern techniques, such as Intelligent Word Recognition, try to use the context a given character is used in and process one word at a time. These more modern techniques also target handwritten text. While OCR nowadays works relatively well for typed text, its accuracy in detecting handwritten text is still limited due to the huge variation in handwritten text (see [Handwriting Recognition](research/concepts/handwriting-recognition.md)).
