# Code Similarity Analysis

#feature #automated

Coding exercises could either be supported with advanced features (e.g., having unit tests run automatically, checking syntax automatically), or we could treat them as normal "essay" questions that can be supported with rubrics, etc.

Specific features tailored to coding exercises are probably out of the scope of our project. Moreover, there already exist reasonable tools in this area.
