# Automated Grouping

#feature #automated

Similar answers are automatically grouped such that they can all be graded at once.

Potential would be big if it works well. Already implemented solutions only work for relatively easy tasks which are not on university level (fill in the blank with simple math or one word, see [[research/tools/Gradescope]]).

A possible scope of application would also be single/multiple choice questions.
