# Fully Automated Grading
#feature #automated 

Fully automated grading of open-ended questions is to the present day not feasible. On one hand, it is by now technically too hard to provide satisfying results. On the other hand, there is a lot of distrust against this kind of technology.

There, however, exist tools for the automated grading of other, more structured, exam formats, such as Excel exams (see [[research/tools/DBF Excel Grading]]) and, obviously, multiple choice. Moreover, there exists a branch of research which is concerned with the automatic grading of essays (see [Ke and NG (2019)](research/resources/Ke-and-Ng-2019.pdf))
