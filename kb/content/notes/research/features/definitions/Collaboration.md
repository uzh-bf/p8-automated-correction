# Collaboration

#feature #assisting

Graders can collaborate on the grading process of (especially) large exams. There are different levels of collaboration: working simultaneously on the same exam but on different exercises (e.g., locking items like in Word), or working simultaneously on the same exercise with synchronization between graders.

Allows sharing of the work between different entities. Probably not requirement for everyone, but a must for some exams.
