# Automated Grading Suggestions
#feature #automated

Tool automatically provides suggestion for graders, e.g. suggestions whether some criteria is fulfilled. Suggestions still have to be verified by human grader. 

Could reduce workload but only if it works well. Would technically be very challenging, expenses probably too high for revenue. Moreover it could be an issue for the consistency of the grading (either because the algorithm is not consistent or because suggestions are not consistently accepted or dismissed).
