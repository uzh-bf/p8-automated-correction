# Access to Student Grades
#feature #assisting 

Software could provide access to anonymized student grades such that the grader can set an appropriate grading curve. The problem is that examiners do not have any information on the average "quality" of students in their course. If the student "quality" is not taken into account, students that take courses with many good students are penalized. 

Software could offer a way to give this information to the graders without violating privacy.
