# Rubrics
#feature #assisting 

A rubric is a set of criteria for the grading of an assignment. In order to evaluate a grade, the rubric is applied to each submission. This should ensure consistency and, in case the rubric can also be acessed by the students, transparency. 

Rubrics can be used when grading manually without technical support, but also when software is in use. 

Rubrics are highly rated in our [survey](research/survey/Summary.md) and implementation should be relatively straightforward. They adress key challenges in the grading process, first and foremost workload and consistency.
