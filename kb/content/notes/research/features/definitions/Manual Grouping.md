# Manual Grouping
#feature #assisting 

All of the responses to a given exercise are manually grouped (e.g., using Drag & Drop) in a step preceding the actual correction process. This should allow grading an exercise across all students in fewer steps.

There might be different persons responsible for the manual grouping vs. the grading of the exam.
