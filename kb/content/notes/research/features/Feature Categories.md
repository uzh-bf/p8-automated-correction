# Feature Categories

#definition

We divide potential features of an semiautomated grading tool into two categories: **assisting** and **automated**

We define the two categories as follows:

- Assisting features merely support the grading process and do not have any direct consequences on how many points a given student is awarded for a given question.
- Automated features may have a direct impact on how many points a student receives for a given question. This includes fully automated point assignment, but also suggestions whether some answer is likely to be right or wrong as the suggestion may bias the examiner.

We differentiate these two kinds of features for the reason that automated features are prone to controversy and must be handled with care if used in a high-stake environment.
