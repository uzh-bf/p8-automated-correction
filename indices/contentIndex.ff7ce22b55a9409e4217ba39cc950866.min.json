{"/":{"title":"P-8 Automated Correction","content":"Welcome to the knowledge base of the P-8 project on *\"Automated Correction of Open-ended Exam Questions\"* that we currently work on at the [BF Teaching Center](https://www.bf.uzh.ch/de/studies/general/teaching-center.html). Our knowledge base contains a summarization of the work we are doing, as well as the resources we provide for your own application.\n\n## Motivation\nA key requirement when performing any kind of exam correction is to guarantee a **valid, objective** and **fair** **grading process**. There is often some room for interpretation when grading, especially in **open-ended** exam questions, where students generate answers themselves (i.e., the solution space is much broader than with, e.g., single-choice questions). **Procedural fairness**–referring to the perception of correctability and consistency–is of importance in the design, conduction and correction process of any exam, and is at the core of our project on “automated correction of exam questions” [1].\n\nOur primary goal is to evaluate whether and how the correction of exams could be supported with **automated tools and procedures**. (Semi-)automated correction of open-ended exam questions has the potential to reduce human subjective judgement, improve fairness for the students, as well as allow lecturers to grade in a more structured and efficient way.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n\n## Supporters\nThis project is part of the swissuniversities initiative _P-8: Digital Skills for You (DISK4U)_. The initiative supports university projects in the field of teaching focusing on digital skills.
