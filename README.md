# P-8 Automated Correction of Open-ended Exam Questions

This repository contains the sources of the project on “Automated Correction of Open-ended Exam Questions” that we currently work on at the BF Teaching Center. The project will consist of multiple parts:

- A knowledge base located in `/kb` that contains a summarization of the work we are doing, as well as the resources we collect for your own application. The knowledge base is also hosted on <https://automated-correction.bf-app.ch/>.
- A correction toolkit located that provides a collection of tools and features that help you grade open-ended exam questions. The scope of this has not been fixed completely.

We are still in the early phases of the project and only the knowledge base will be provided for now. The correction toolkit will be published as soon as we have tested and validated everything to ensure you have a stable experience.

## Contributing

We welcome any contributions to project (e.g., the addition of a new tool or feature to the knowledge base). However, as the project scope is not yet set in stone, please contact us beforehand.

## License

The project and all of its subprojects are licensed under the AGPLv3.
