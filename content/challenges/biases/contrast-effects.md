# Contrast Effects

#bias

Contrast effects describe the well documented tendency to judge things relative to each other rather than on their own merit (see [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect)).

This can have an influence on grading when an answer is graded after several bad (good) answers. Since the bad (good) answers are now the reference, the current answer may receive more (less) points.
