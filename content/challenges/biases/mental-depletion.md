#bias

Mental depletion may bias the judgment of people. A situation where this bias manifests is the [Hungry Judge Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_judge_effect).

A similar situation could occur when the examiner tends to award less points in the end of a grading session. If the same student is always graded at the end, this may have a substantial effect on the points of students.

[Shuffling](research/features/definitions/shuffling.md) could address parts of these bias as the students that are graded in the end are not the same for every exercise.
