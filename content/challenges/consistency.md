# Consistency

#challenge

Grading open-ended questions consistently is a big challenge according to the participants of our [survey](research/survey/Summary-of-Initial-Survey.md). The goal is that same (similar) answers are awarded the same (a similar) amount of points.

There are several possible sources of inconsistency:

- Same grader is inconsistent across students

  - [Biases](research/challenges/biases/biases.md) systematically affect the grading
  - There is an (unsystematic) error when awarding points due to the fact that humans' judgment is inconsistent

- Multiple grades have different views on same exercise

Many of the sources of inconsistency can be adressed through the use of software, e.g. through [Rubrics](research/features/definitions/rubrics.md).
