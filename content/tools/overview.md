# Overview

#tool #overview

We created an overview for the grading tools:

- [Gradescope](research/tools/Gradescope)
- [CodeExpert](research/tools/Codeexpert)
- [Crowdmark](research/tools/Crowdmark)
- [Ans](research/tools/Ans)
- [DBF Excel Grading](research/tools/DBF-Excel-Grading)
- [Graide](research/tools/Graide)

We tried to gather evidence for efficiency gains of [Gradescope](research/tools/Gradescope) and [Crowdmark](research/tools/Crowdmark).

Other tools that would potentially be interesting (but we did not create an overview for or resources are not publicly available) include:

- [Athene](https://github.com/ls1intum/Athene)
- [Essay Feedback Tool of H5P](https://h5p.org/content-types/essay)
- [Pearson Automated Scoring Software](https://www.pearsonassessments.com/large-scale-assessments/k-12-large-scale-assessments/automated-scoring.html)
- [TestWe](https://testwe.eu/en/)
